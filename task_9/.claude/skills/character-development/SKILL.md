# Instructions    

1. **Collect Required Character Inputs**    

    If not provided, ask the user for:
    - Character name   
    - Role in story (protagonist, antagonist, sidekick, etc.)   
    - Age, occupation, and brief physical description   
    - One-line emotional state or core need (e.g., “wants belonging”)   
    - Backstory highlights (trauma, turning points, secrets)   


2. **Build a Robust Character Profile**    

    For each character generate sections:   
    - Overview: short paragraph summarizing who they are and why they matter.   
    - Core motivations & goals: internal and external.   
    - Strengths & weaknesses: behavioral and emotional.    
    - Values / beliefs: what they would sacrifice for.   
    - Flaws & fears: for conflict and growth.   
    - Physicality & voice: distinctive mannerisms, dialect, gestures.   


3. **Create Character Arcs**   

    - Describe the starting state (beliefs, flaws).   
    - Define inciting event that begins internal change.   
    - Outline key turning points that force choice and change (3–5 beats).   
    - Define the end state — how the character is transformed (positive, negative, stagnant).    
    - Provide mini-synopsis showing how arc ties to main plot.   
    
    
4. **Scene-Level Character Beats**   

    - For given scenes, suggest 2–4 beats showing character choices and emotional shifts.    
    - Provide suggested dialogue snippets or internal thoughts (1–2 lines) to capture voice.     
    
    
5. **Relationships & Dynamics**   


    - Map character relationships (ally, rival, mentor, love interest).   
    - For each relationship, provide: shared history, conflict sources, and potential growth   
    

6. **Consistency & Reuse**   

    - Keep a canonical profile (key facts) to reference across the story.    
    - Flag contradictions between character behavior and previously stated traits.
