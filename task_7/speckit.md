# 🔹 What is SPECKit Plus? – Write a short note.

Spec Kit is a framework where you build software by writing clear specifications first instead of jumping straight into coding. You describe what the app should do, and Spec Kit uses that to create plans, tasks, and even help generate code with AI tools. Basically we use AI tools to execute the frameworks commands.

## Writing short answers of the core concepts of Speckit Plus 🎨:

### 1. 📜 Constitution Phase
Project-wide rules apply to everything, while a Specification is the rule set for one specific item.

### 2. ✏ Specify Phase
Making your idea exact so AI knows exactly what to build.

### 3. 🧠 Plan Phase
Plan is turning the spec into a clear build strategy that guides all future tasks.

### 4. 📝 Tasks Phase
Small, clear action steps that guide the agent through the work safely and correctly.

### 5. ⚙ Implement Phase
Executing the plan with AI, but with you staying in control at every step.
